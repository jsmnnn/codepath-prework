## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Some of my favorite applications inlcude:
- Instagram
    - Editing messages sent
    - Uploading pictures to a collective feed
- Youtube
    - Minimize videos to play while navigating the app
    - Play videos in the background
- Spotify
    - View the current song playing while navigating the app
    - Create playlists

An idea for an application:
- Playlist Moodboard
    Improving on top of Spotify, the Playlist Moodboard app would
    take in images or keywords from a user to form a moodboard that then
    creates a Spotify playlist that matches the moodboard. For example, if
    the user uploads pictures of flowers and adds a keyword of 'Spring', the
    app would try to find songs that have album covers, lyrics, or titles
    that match the mood. 

## Notes

I navigated Xcode for the first time with this project.
